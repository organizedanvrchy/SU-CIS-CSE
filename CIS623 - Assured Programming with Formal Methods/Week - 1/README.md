# Definitions, Theorems, and Proofs

## Definitions
- **Definition:** A precise and unambiguous explanation of a concept, object, or property. Definitions serve as the foundation for building theorems and proofs.
- **Key Features:**
  - Exactness: Definitions must leave no room for ambiguity.
  - Contextual Relevance: Definitions apply to a specific area or domain.
- **Examples:**
  - **Set:** A collection of distinct objects, often called elements.
  - **Prime Number:** A positive integer greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and itself.

## Theorems
- **Theorem:** A statement that has been proven to be true using definitions, axioms, and previously established theorems.
- **Structure:**
  1. **Hypothesis (Assumptions):** The conditions that must be true for the theorem to hold.
  2. **Conclusion:** The result or claim of the theorem.
- **Examples:**
  - **Pythagorean Theorem:** In a right triangle, \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the legs, and \(c\) is the hypotenuse.
  - **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** Relates differentiation and integration, providing a method to evaluate definite integrals.

  2. **Indirect Proof (Contradiction):** Ass

## Types of Proof

### 1. Proof by Construction
- **Definition:** A constructive proof demonstrates the existence of an entity or the validity of a statement by explicitly constructing an example or process.
- **Steps:**
  1. Clearly state what is to be proven.
  2. Construct the required entity or demonstrate the process step-by-step.
  3. Conclude with the validity of the statement based on the construction.
- **Example:**
  Prove that \( p \lor \neg p \) (Law of the Excluded Middle) is a tautology by constructing its truth table:
  <br>
  | \( p \) | \( \neg p \) | \( p \lor \neg p \) |
  |:-------:|:-----------:|:------------------:|
  | True    | False       | True               |
  | False   | True        | True               |
  <br>
  - The truth table shows that \( p \lor \neg p \) is always true, confirming it is a tautology.
### 2. Proof by Contradiction
- **Definition:** A proof that begins by assuming the negation of the statement to be proven and then derives a logical contradiction.
- **Steps:**
  1. Assume the negation of the statement.
  2. Use logical reasoning to derive a contradiction.
  3. Conclude that the original statement must be true since its negation leads to a contradiction.
- **Example:**
  Prove that \( \sqrt{2} \) is irrational:
  1. Assume \( \sqrt{2} \) is rational, i.e., \( \sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are integers with no common factors.
  2. Square both sides: \( 2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2} \), or \( p^2 = 2q^2 \).
  3. This implies \( p^2 \) is even, so \( p \) must also be even (\( p = 2k \) for some integer \( k \)).
  4. Substituting \( p = 2k \) into \( p^2 = 2q^2 \), we get \( (2k)^2 = 2q^2 \), or \( 4k^2 = 2q^2 \), simplifying to \( q^2 = 2k^2 \).
  5. This implies \( q^2 \) is also even, so \( q \) must be even.
  6. If both \( p \) and \( q \) are even, they share a common factor of 2, contradicting the assumption that \( p \) and \( q \) have no common factors.
  7. Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \) is irrational.

### 3. Proof by Induction
- **Definition:** A proof technique used to show that a statement holds for all integers \( n \geq n_0 \), using a base case and an inductive step.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Base Case:** Verify that the statement holds for the initial value \( n_0 \).
  2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume the statement is true for \( n = k \).
  3. **Inductive Step:** Prove the statement holds for \( n = k + 1 \) using the inductive hypothesis.
  4. Conclude that the statement is true for all \( n \geq n_0 \).
- **Example:**
  Prove that the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( S(n) = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \):
  1. **Base Case:** For \( n = 1 \), \( S(1) = \frac{1(1 + 1)}{2} = 1 \). True.
  2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume \( S(k) = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \) is true for \( n = k \).
  3. **Inductive Step:** Prove \( S(k + 1) = \frac{(k + 1)((k + 1) + 1)}{2} \):
     \[
     S(k + 1) = S(k) + (k + 1) = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + (k + 1).
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     S(k + 1) = \frac{k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1)}{2} = \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2}.
     \]
  4. Therefore, by induction, the formula is true for all \( n \geq 1 \).

# Basic Set Notation, Subsets, and Set Operations
Sets are fundamental to mathematics and computer science, forming the basis for concepts in logic, data structures, and relational databases.

## Basic Set Notation
- **Set Definition:** A collection of distinct objects, called elements, represented as \( A = \{a, b, c\} \).

  - **\( \notin \):** Indicates non-membership, e.g., \( d \notin A \).
  - **\( \emptyset \):** The empty set, containing no elements.
  - **\( |A| \):** Cardinality of \( A \), i.e., the number of elements in \( A \).
- **Examples:**
  - \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \)
  - \( B = \{x \mid x \text{ is a positive even number}\} = \{2, 4, 6, \dots\} \)

## Subsets

- **Notation:**
  - \( A \subseteq B \): \( A \) is a subset of \( B \).
  - \( A \subset B \): \( A \) is a proper subset of \( B \) (\( A \neq B \)).
  - \( A \not\subseteq B \): \( A \) is not a subset of \( B \).
- **Examples:**
  - \( A = \{1, 2\}, B = \{1, 2, 3\} \) → \( A \subseteq B \)

### 4. Complement (\( A' \))
- **Definition:** The set of all elements not in \( A \), relative to a universal set \( U \).
- **Formula:** \( A' = \{x \mid x \in U \text{ and } x \notin A\} \)
- **Example:** If \( U = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}, A = \{1, 2\} \) → \( A' = \{3, 4\} \)

### 5. Cartesian Product (\( A \times B \))
- **Definition:** The set of all ordered pairs where the first element is from \( A \) and the second is from \( B \).
- **Formula:** \( A \times B = \{(a, b) \mid a \in A, b \in B\} \)
- **Example:** \( A = \{1, 2\}, B = \{x, y\} \) → \( A \times B = \{(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y)\} \)

## Properties of Set Operations

# Functions and Function Composition

## Functions
### Definition:
A **function** is a relation between a set of inputs (domain) and a set of outputs (codomain) where each input is mapped to exactly one output.

### Notation:
- A function \( f \) from set \( A \) to set \( B \) is written as:
  \[
  f: A \to B
  \]
  where \( f(x) = y \), \( x \in A \), and \( y \in B \).

### Key Terms:
- **Domain:** The set of all possible inputs (\( A \)).
- **Codomain:** The set of all possible outputs (\( B \)).
- **Range:** The set of actual outputs produced by \( f \).

### Types of Functions:
1. **Injective (One-to-One):** Every element of the codomain is mapped to at most one element of the domain.
2. **Surjective (Onto):** Every element of the codomain is mapped by at least one element of the domain.
3. **Bijective:** A function that is both injective and surjective.

## Function Composition
### Definition:
**Function composition** combines two functions \( f \) and \( g \) such that the output of \( g \) becomes the input of \( f \). The composed function is written as \( (f \circ g)(x) \), defined as:
\[
(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))
\]

### Properties:
1. **Associative:** \( f \circ (g \circ h) = (f \circ g) \circ h \)
2. **Identity Function:** Composing a function with the identity function \( I(x) = x \) leaves the function unchanged:
   \[
   f \circ I = f \quad \text{and} \quad I \circ f = f
   \]

### Example:
Let \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \) and \( g(x) = x^2 \).
- Composition \( (f \circ g)(x) \):
  \[
  (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x^2) = 2x^2 + 3
  \]
- Composition \( (g \circ f)(x) \):
  \[
  (g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(2x + 3) = (2x + 3)^2
  \]

## Applications in Computer Science
1. **Pipeline Design:** Combining smaller functions to process data sequentially.
2. **Algorithm Design:** Breaking problems into modular steps using composed functions.
3. **Functional Programming:** Core principle in languages like Haskell and Scala.

# Relations, Binary Relations, and Relational Composition

## Relations
### Definition:
A **relation** is a subset of the Cartesian product of two sets. If \( A \) and \( B \) are two sets, a relation \( R \) from \( A \) to \( B \) is defined as:
\[
R \subseteq A \times B
\]
It associates elements of \( A \) (domain) with elements of \( B \) (codomain).

### Notation:
If \( (a, b) \in R \), we write \( a \, R \, b \), meaning \( a \) is related to \( b \).

## Binary Relations
### Definition:
A **binary relation** is a relation between two sets \( A \) and \( B \), or within a single set \( A \):
- \( R \subseteq A \times A \) (when \( A = B \)).

### Properties of Binary Relations:
1. **Reflexive:** \( \forall a \in A, (a, a) \in R \).
2. **Symmetric:** \( \forall a, b \in A, (a, b) \in R \implies (b, a) \in R \).
3. **Antisymmetric:** \( \forall a, b \in A, (a, b) \in R \text{ and } (b, a) \in R \implies a = b \).
4. **Transitive:** \( \forall a, b, c \in A, (a, b) \in R \text{ and } (b, c) \in R \implies (a, c) \in R \).

### Examples:
1. \( R = \{(1, 2), (2, 3)\} \), where \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \):
   - \( 1 \, R \, 2 \) and \( 2 \, R \, 3 \).
2. Equality relation: \( a = b \).
3. Less-than relation: \( a < b \).

## Relational Composition
### Definition:
The **composition of two relations** \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) is a relation \( R_1 \circ R_2 \) such that:
\[
R_1 \circ R_2 = \{(a, c) \mid \exists b \, \text{such that} \, (a, b) \in R_2 \, \text{and} \, (b, c) \in R_1\}
\]

### Example:
Let \( R_1 = \{(2, 3), (3, 4)\} \) and \( R_2 = \{(1, 2), (2, 3)\} \):
- \( R_1 \circ R_2 = \{(1, 3)\} \).

### Properties:
1. **Associative:** \( R_1 \circ (R_2 \circ R_3) = (R_1 \circ R_2) \circ R_3 \).
2. **Identity Relation:** Composing with the identity relation \( I = \{(a, a) \mid a \in A\} \) leaves the relation unchanged:
   \[
   R \circ I = R \quad \text{and} \quad I \circ R = R
   \]


## Applications in Computer Science
1. **Databases:** Queries on relational databases use relations and compositions to filter and join data.
2. **State Machines:** Transitions between states are modeled using relations.
3. **Graph Theory:** Relations represent edges in directed graphs, and relational composition is used for pathfinding.
