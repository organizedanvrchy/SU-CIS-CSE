# Definitions, Theorems, and Proofs

## Definitions
- **Definition:** A precise and unambiguous explanation of a concept, object, or property. Definitions serve as the foundation for building theorems and proofs.
- **Key Features:**
  - Exactness: Definitions must leave no room for ambiguity.
  - Contextual Relevance: Definitions apply to a specific area or domain.
- **Examples:**
  - **Set:** A collection of distinct objects, often called elements.
  - **Prime Number:** A positive integer greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and itself.

---

## Theorems
- **Theorem:** A statement that has been proven to be true using definitions, axioms, and previously established theorems.
- **Structure:**
  1. **Hypothesis (Assumptions):** The conditions that must be true for the theorem to hold.
  2. **Conclusion:** The result or claim of the theorem.
- **Examples:**
  - **Pythagorean Theorem:** In a right triangle, \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the legs, and \(c\) is the hypotenuse.
  - **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** Relates differentiation and integration, providing a method to evaluate definite integrals.

## Types of Proof

### 1. Proof by Construction
- **Definition:** A constructive proof demonstrates the existence of an entity or the validity of a statement by explicitly constructing an example or process.
- **Steps:**
  1. Clearly state what is to be proven.
  2. Construct the required entity or demonstrate the process step-by-step.
  3. Conclude with the validity of the statement based on the construction.
- **Example:**
  Prove that \( p \lor \neg p \) (Law of the Excluded Middle) is a tautology by constructing its truth table:
  | \( p \) | \( \neg p \) | \( p \lor \neg p \) |
  |:-------:|:-----------:|:------------------:|
  | True    | False       | True               |
  | False   | True        | True               |
  - The truth table shows that \( p \lor \neg p \) is always true, confirming it is a tautology.

---

### 2. Proof by Contradiction
- **Definition:** A proof that begins by assuming the negation of the statement to be proven and then derives a logical contradiction.
- **Steps:**
  1. Assume the negation of the statement.
  2. Use logical reasoning to derive a contradiction.
  3. Conclude that the original statement must be true since its negation leads to a contradiction.
- **Example:**
  Prove that \( \sqrt{2} \) is irrational:
  1. Assume \( \sqrt{2} \) is rational, i.e., \( \sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are integers with no common factors.
  2. Square both sides: \( 2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2} \), or \( p^2 = 2q^2 \).
  3. This implies \( p^2 \) is even, so \( p \) must also be even (\( p = 2k \) for some integer \( k \)).
  4. Substituting \( p = 2k \) into \( p^2 = 2q^2 \), we get \( (2k)^2 = 2q^2 \), or \( 4k^2 = 2q^2 \), simplifying to \( q^2 = 2k^2 \).
  5. This implies \( q^2 \) is also even, so \( q \) must be even.
  6. If both \( p \) and \( q \) are even, they share a common factor of 2, contradicting the assumption that \( p \) and \( q \) have no common factors.
  7. Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \) is irrational.

---

### 3. Proof by Induction
- **Definition:** A proof technique used to show that a statement holds for all integers \( n \geq n_0 \), using a base case and an inductive step.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Base Case:** Verify that the statement holds for the initial value \( n_0 \).
  2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume the statement is true for \( n = k \).
  3. **Inductive Step:** Prove the statement holds for \( n = k + 1 \) using the inductive hypothesis.
  4. Conclude that the statement is true for all \( n \geq n_0 \).
- **Example:**
  Prove that the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( S(n) = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \):
  1. **Base Case:** For \( n = 1 \), \( S(1) = \frac{1(1 + 1)}{2} = 1 \). True.
  2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume \( S(k) = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \) is true for \( n = k \).
  3. **Inductive Step:** Prove \( S(k + 1) = \frac{(k + 1)((k + 1) + 1)}{2} \):
     \[
     S(k + 1) = S(k) + (k + 1) = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + (k + 1).
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     S(k + 1) = \frac{k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1)}{2} = \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2}.
     \]
  4. Therefore, by induction, the formula is true for all \( n \geq 1 \).
