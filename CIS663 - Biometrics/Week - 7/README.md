# Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Detection Error Tradeoff (DET)

## Introduction to ROC Curves
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are graphical plots used to evaluate the performance of binary classification models. They illustrate the trade-off between sensitivity (True Positive Rate) and specificity (1 - False Positive Rate) across different threshold settings.

## ROC Curves: Simplest Case
In the simplest case, the ROC curve is constructed by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various decision thresholds. A classifier with random performance results in a diagonal line, whereas an optimal classifier approaches the upper left corner of the plot.

## ROC Curve Examples
Below are different cases of ROC curves:

- **Good Test:** The curve bows significantly toward the upper left corner.
- **Bad Test:** The curve is close to the diagonal line.
- **Best Test:** The curve reaches (0,1), indicating perfect classification.
- **Worst Test:** The curve bows below the diagonal, indicating inverse classification.

## Test Statistics and the 2-Class Confusion Matrix
A binary classification model is evaluated using a confusion matrix:

|               | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Actual Positive** | True Positive (TP) | False Negative (FN) |
| **Actual Negative** | False Positive (FP) | True Negative (TN) |

Metrics derived from the confusion matrix:
- **True Positive Rate (TPR) / Sensitivity:** \( \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \)
- **False Positive Rate (FPR):** \( \frac{FP}{FP + TN} \)
- **Specificity:** \( 1 - FPR \)

### Classical Estimation
Classical methods for estimating ROC curves involve computing TPR and FPR at various threshold levels and interpolating between points.

## ROC Curve Estimation with Continuous Data
For continuous data, ROC curves are estimated using:
- **Empirical methods** that use sample points to compute TPR and FPR.
- **Parametric approaches** assuming a distribution of scores.
- **Non-parametric methods** such as the Mann-Whitney U test.

## Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)
### Interpretation of AUC
AUC measures the overall ability of the classifier to distinguish between classes. Its interpretation is as follows:
- **AUC = 1.0:** Perfect classifier.
- **AUC > 0.9:** Excellent classifier.
- **AUC ~ 0.5:** Random classifier.
- **AUC < 0.5:** Worse than random (incorrect classification dominance).

### Problems with AUC
- **Overly optimistic evaluation:** AUC can be high even when the classifier is weak in specific regions.
- **Ignores threshold choice:** AUC considers all thresholds equally, which may not be practical.
- **Does not distinguish between types of errors:** In some domains, false positives and false negatives have different costs.

## Detection Error Tradeoff (DET)
### Introduction
The Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) curve is a variation of the ROC curve that plots False Negative Rate (FNR) against False Positive Rate (FPR) on a logarithmic scale to highlight error tradeoffs.

### DET Curve
A DET curve provides a better visualization when error rates are low, revealing subtle performance differences between classifiers.

## Decision Cost Function (DCF)
The Decision Cost Function (DCF) incorporates costs of false positives and false negatives to assess a classifier's performance in a given operational setting. It is typically defined as:
\[
DCF = C_{fn} P_{fn} P_{target} + C_{fp} P_{fp} (1 - P_{target})
\]
where:
- \( C_{fn}, C_{fp} \) are the costs of false negatives and false positives.
- \( P_{fn}, P_{fp} \) are the probabilities of false negatives and false positives.
- \( P_{target} \) is the prior probability of the target class.

### Explanation
- When false positives are more costly, the decision threshold is set higher.
- When false negatives are more costly, the decision threshold is set lower.
- The optimal operating point minimizes DCF, considering the trade-off between error types.

## Conclusion
ROC and DET curves are essential tools for evaluating classifier performance. While ROC curves provide an overall assessment, DET curves offer detailed insight into error tradeoffs. AUC helps summarize ROC performance but has limitations in real-world decision-making. Decision Cost Functions allow classifiers to be optimized for specific use cases based on error costs.
