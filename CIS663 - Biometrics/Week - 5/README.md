# Iris Recognition
## Introduction
Iris recognition is a biometric identification technology that uses the unique patterns of the human iris to authenticate and identify individuals. It is widely used for secure access control, financial transactions, and surveillance systems.

## What is the Iris?
The iris is the colored, ring-shaped part of the eye surrounding the pupil. It contains intricate patterns formed by crypts, filaments, and ridges, making it an ideal candidate for biometric recognition.

## Why Iris?
- **Uniqueness:** No two irises are identical, even in identical twins.  
- **Stability:** The iris pattern remains stable throughout life.  
- **Security:** Highly detailed patterns are difficult to forge.  
- **Non-Invasive:** Safe and contactless identification process.

## Methods of Iris Recognition System
### **Image Acquisition**
Capture high-resolution iris images using infrared cameras for clarity and consistency under various lighting conditions.

### Segmentation
Isolate the iris from the surrounding eye regions, such as the sclera and pupil, using advanced boundary detection algorithms.

    <summary>Eyelid and Eyelash</summary>
    
  - **Eyelid Detection:**  
    Eyelids can partially occlude the iris, so detecting their position is essential. Techniques used include:
    - **Parabolic Curve Fitting:** A parabolic model is fit to the detected edge points of the eyelid curve.  
    - **Edge Detection Filters:** Sobel or Canny edge detectors help identify the boundary of the eyelids.  
    - **Morphological Operations:** These are used to refine edge detection results.  
     
  - **Eyelash Detection:**  
    Eyelashes may obstruct the iris region and affect feature extraction.
    - **Intensity Thresholding:** Eyelashes are often darker than the surrounding regions; thresholding helps identify them.  
    - **Morphological Processing:** Techniques like dilation and erosion remove isolated eyelashes while preserving the iris structure.  
    - **Region Masking:** Detected eyelashes are masked to ignore their influence during feature extraction.

    <summary>Hough Transform for Circular Detection</summary>
    
  The Hough Transform is a popular technique for detecting circular shapes, such as the boundaries of the pupil and iris. It works by transforming edge points in an image space to parameter space and identifying the parameters (center and radius) that best describe a circle.  
    
  - **Steps in Hough Transform for Iris Segmentation:**  
    1. **Edge Detection:** Apply an edge detection algorithm (like Canny) to find potential boundaries.  
    2. **Voting in Parameter Space:** Map each edge point to all possible circles that can pass through it, accumulating votes in a parameter space.  
    3. **Circle Detection:** Identify the parameters (center and radius) with the highest votes as the detected circle.  
  
  - **Advantages of Hough Transform:**  
    - Robust to noise and occlusions.  
    - Effective for detecting circular and near-circular shapes.

  <summary>Daugman’s Rubber Sheet Model (by Daugman)</summary>
  
  Daugman’s Rubber Sheet Model is one of the most widely used normalization techniques in iris recognition.
  
  - **Concept:**  
    This model maps the iris from its circular form to a fixed-size rectangular polar coordinate system (radius and angle).
    
  - **Process:**  
    - The center of the pupil serves as the reference point.  
    - Points on the iris boundary are projected outward radially.
    - The model compensates for size and rotation differences caused by varying pupil dilation.
  
  - **Advantages:**  
    - Ensures uniformity across varying iris images.  
    - Reduces distortions caused by pupil dilation or eye rotation.
