# Iris Recognition
## Introduction
Iris recognition is a biometric identification technology that uses the unique patterns of the human iris to authenticate and identify individuals. It is widely used for secure access control, financial transactions, and surveillance systems.

## What is the Iris?
The iris is the colored, ring-shaped part of the eye surrounding the pupil. It contains intricate patterns formed by crypts, filaments, and ridges, making it an ideal candidate for biometric recognition.

## Why Iris?
- **Uniqueness:** No two irises are identical, even in identical twins.  
- **Stability:** The iris pattern remains stable throughout life.  
- **Security:** Highly detailed patterns are difficult to forge.  
- **Non-Invasive:** Safe and contactless identification process.

## History of Iris Recognition
- **1936:** Dr. Frank Burch proposed the use of the iris for identification.  
- **1987:** Dr. Aran Safir and Dr. Leonard Flom patented iris recognition.  
- **1993:** Dr. John Daugman developed the first functional iris recognition algorithm.

## Applications
- **Security & Access Control:** Airports, secure facilities, and government sites.  
- **Finance:** Banking authentication and ATM access.  
- **Healthcare:** Patient identification in hospitals.  
- **Law Enforcement:** Criminal identification and tracking.

## Methods of Iris Recognition System
### **Image Acquisition**
Capture high-resolution iris images using infrared cameras for clarity and consistency under various lighting conditions.

### Segmentation
Isolate the iris from the surrounding eye regions, such as the sclera and pupil, using advanced boundary detection algorithms.

### Normalization
Transform the segmented iris into a standard rectangular format to ensure consistency during feature extraction.

### Iris Feature Encoding
Extract unique features from the normalized iris image and encode them into a binary format called the iris code.

### Iris Code Matching
Compare the generated iris code with stored templates to authenticate identity.

## Disadvantages
- **High Costs:** Specialized cameras and equipment are expensive.  
- **Environmental Factors:** Accuracy may be affected by lighting or subject movement.  
- **Privacy Concerns:** Potential misuse of biometric data.
